# Implementation Plan: Music Lovers — V1

**Branch**: `001-project-music-lovers` | **Date**: 2025-09-16 | **Spec**: specs/001-project-music-lovers/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-project-music-lovers/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
A mobile-first web app to search an artist and surface a unified feed (News, YouTube, SoundCloud, Spotify) using only free/official APIs or public RSS/oEmbed. V1 emphasizes speed (TTFB ≤ 400ms, LCP ≤ 2.5s), accessibility (WCAG AA), and ZA-first ranking, with server-key-gated admin pin/note.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript (strict)
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 15 (App Router), Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, Lucide, Framer Motion (light), Convex
**Storage**: Convex database (as cache + persistence)
**Testing**: Unit tests + Playwright smoke; Lighthouse checks
**Target Platform**: Web (Vercel); mobile-first responsive
**Project Type**: web
**Performance Goals**: TTFB ≤ 400ms, LCP ≤ 2.5s (mobile 4G), CLS ≈ 0
**Constraints**: Free/official sources only; no downloads; server-side keys; regional ZA-first ranking
**Scale/Scope**: V1, single feature area, ~8 days build

## Constitution Check
- MVP-First aggregator: PASS — focuses on artist search + aggregation
- Simple API and partial failures: PASS — adapters return partials with per-source status
- Quality gates: PASS — health, smoke tests, timeouts/backoff
- Compliance & Attribution: PASS — official APIs/RSS only, links to sources
- Operational Simplicity: PASS — env-only config; structured logs; semver
- Tech Preference: PASS — honors Next.js + Convex + Vercel stack
- Mobile-First: PASS — responsive, tap targets, lazy embeds, reduced motion

**Structure Decision**: Web application

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
- Unknowns resolved by assumptions in spec; confirm free-tier quotas and rate-limits.
- Best practices to confirm: Next.js streaming/ISR with Convex; RSS reliability; oEmbed limits.

Output created: `research.md` with decisions, rationales, and alternatives.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
- Data model captured in `data-model.md`.
- Contracts directory contains endpoint/function contracts for adapters and Convex functions.
- Quickstart includes env setup, running locally, and test commands.

Outputs created: `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md` with failing tests placeholders.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
- Use /tasks to generate ~25-30 tasks from contracts, data model, and quickstart; TDD ordering; parallel-friendly labeling.

## Complexity Tracking
None — no deviations from constitution.

## Progress Tracking
**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [ ] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [ ] Complexity deviations documented
